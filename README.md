#Plugin csv to report
CSV to report makes it easy to fetch content from csv-file(s) and put content from that file/those files and save it to html file. Than display the html(table) on a page with a single shortcode. The strength
of this plugin is that it does fetch the actual content directly from the file(s) without having to import/export any file(s). So any changes in the file(s) will be 
updated when you view your table(s) with this plugin.

#Plugin Wp comment replace
If you got too many spams on your wordpress web site, you can use comments and replcae all urls for yours. It's need for websites where many comments and where content generated.
